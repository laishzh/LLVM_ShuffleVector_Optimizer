To make the project, navigate to the source path and type command "make".

To test the example, type command with certain example instance like:
    opt -load build/lib/ShuffleVectorReplacementPass.so -shfRplc test-blend/test/blend_unaligned.ll -o test-blend/result/blend_unaligned.bc
And make it readable:
    llvm-dis test-blend/result/blend_unaligned.bc
Then a .ll file can be checked at ./test-blend/result/blend_unalighed.ll

The final version of the source code is ./Pass/shfRplc.cpp,
a tidier one is ./Pass/shfRplc_indent.cpp. It's generated by command "indent ./Pass/shfRplc.cpp -kr -o ./Pass/shfRplc_indent.cpp"
The source code is written with enough comments.
